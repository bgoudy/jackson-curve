            <h3>The historic Piedmont Mercantile Building, constructed in 1905 and on the National Register of Historic Places, is being meticulously restored to its past glory. Coming in the late Spring of 2020, The Village Lofts At Piedmont will be uniquely situated on the upper floor of the restored former textile Mercantile Building in the downtown village of Piedmont, South Carolina.  The Village Lofts At Piedmont consists of 8 unique luxury loft apartments and will offer spacious one bedroom, one bedroom plus study or two bedroom units for rent.  
                  <br>
                  <br>   
            The history of this beautiful building will remain and highlighted in each individual loft apartment.  All units will feature 14’ – 15’ ceilings, massive wood beams in the ceiling, exposed brick, original restored wood floors, and massive historically accurate windows. All of this is situated in the old village of Piedmont which is prominently situated in the heart of downtown overlooking the scenic Saluda River, the 1874 historic pedestrian footbridge and the spectacular views of the scenic dam and falls.
